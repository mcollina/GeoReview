GeoReview
====================

Introduction
------------

GeoReview is a demo application built by [Mavigex][1] for the [WhyMCA conference][2].
You can find the slides of the presentation here (missing link).

GeoReview is an extremely simple use case of a geolocalized review
application, and we open sourced it for the conference.

Setup the Development Environment
---------------------------------

This application requires a full ruby installation plus bundler, and I
recommend using [RVM][3] to manage it. 
To setup the development environment you should:

1. Install bundler `gem install bundler`.
2. Clone the repository `git clone git://github.com/mcollina/GeoReview.git`.
3. Install all required dependency `bundle install`.
4. Run it `rackup`.
5. Point your browser to [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).
